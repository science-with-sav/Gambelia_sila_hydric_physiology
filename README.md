# *Gambelia sila* hydric physiology

This repository houses all the data and code associated with the publication "Hydric Physiology and Ecology of a Federally Endangered Desert Lizard" by Savannah Weaver, Ian Axsom, Lindsay Peria, Tess McIntyre, Justin Chung, Rory Telemeco, Mike Westphal, and Emily Taylor, published in *Conservation Physiology* in 2024. 

Each of the "wrangling" files takes in the sometimes numerous files with raw data, assesses technical replicates, and formats data classes. All the wrangled data is then saved as .RDS files, which are used in the analysis files. The analysis files are numbered in no particular order. All of the raw and cleaned data are in the "data" folder. Figures and statistics presented in the publication can be found in the "results" folder, in addition to figures/stats and versions of figures that were not published. 

Readers of the paper and users of this code are encouraged to email questions to Savannah Weaver at savannahjweaver@gmail.com.
