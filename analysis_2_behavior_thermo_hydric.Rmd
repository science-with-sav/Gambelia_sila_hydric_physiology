Temp response variables to test vs hydric physiology
-	Mean daily VTmax
-	Tset (IQR of field-active Tb okay???)
-	Db = thermoregulatory accuracy

Telemetry response variables to test vs hydric physiology
-	Microhabitat use = proportion of observations doing x (above, partial shade, full shade, burrow)
-	Time of onset of estivation (once you no longer ever get aboveground obs)
